# pir

pir will be a 2-player fight-the-horde style game, similar to COD Zombies or Left For Dead.

Planned Features:
- 2 players, one with WASD to move and F to use whatever they are holding (E to pick up items), and the other Arrow Keys to move and L to use held item (P to pick up items).
- The twist of the game is that you can only hold 1 item each, and whenever you pick up an item it simply swaps with your held item.
- Since you can't both aim with one mouse, your direction determines where you are aiming (8 directions, Left Right Up Down and diagonals)
- Weapons may include:
  Axe (wide swing but melee, good damage, MAKE SURE IT HAS A VISUAL FOR THE SWING), AWP (big range, big single-target damage, but low atk spd), Rifle (good rate of fire, but bad ammo consumption, normal amount of damage), Shotgun (closer range (bullets fade away at a closer distance), mid atk spd, great damage if all bullets are hit), Grenade (single use throwable that explodes after 1 second, big damage but fast zombies can escape its radius), Health pack (can only use on a teammate (pressing the use button near them), heals all damage, single use), Wall (single use, places a wall that blocks off zombies, but the zombies can break it. shooting the wall deals damage to it too)

Before the game starts, each player chooses between Axe, Rifle, and Shotgun as their starting weapon. More weapons/items can be rarely dropped by zombies.
The player get launched back a little with the AWP, Rifle, and Shotgun.
Shotgun launches back a bit, Rifle is a tiny knockback with each bullet, and the AWP sends you a bit further than the Shotgun.
When a player is defeated, increase healthpack spawn chance and if a healthpack is used on them they get revived to half of their max HP
